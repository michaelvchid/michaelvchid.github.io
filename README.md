# PIC16B Demonstration Website

This repository hosts a website that contains previous projects that I have worked on, including blog posts that walk through the production of the projects to guide users. 

This is lightly modified from Barry Clark's excellent [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/).
