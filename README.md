# PIC16B Demonstration Website

This repository hosts a website that contains previous projects (blog posts) that I have worked on throughout Fall of 2021. It is lightly modified from Barry Clark's excellent [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/). To view, simply go to [michaelvchid.github.io](https://michaelvchid.github.io/).
