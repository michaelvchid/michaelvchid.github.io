Hello! My name is Michael Chidbachian and I am a student studying mathematics and computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles. This website is part of an ongoing project started in Fall 2021 to showcase the different projects I have created using Python in a tutorial-style format. Though the initial blog posts were part of a Python with Applications II course which has now ended, this website will occasionally be updated with new work. 

If you have any questions regarding any posts, Python, UCLA or anything else, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contacts!
