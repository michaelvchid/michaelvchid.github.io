Hello! My name is Michael Chidbachian and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles where I studied mathematics and computer science. This website was originally part of an ongoing project started in Fall 2021 to showcase the different projects I have created using Python in a tutorial-style format. Though the initial blog posts were part of a Python with Applications II course which has now ended, this website will continue to be updated will all sorts of projects.

If you have any questions regarding any posts, Python, UCLA or anything else, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contacts!
